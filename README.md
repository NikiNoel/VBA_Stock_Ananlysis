# Summary
While refactoring the code has an advantage with speed, a negative side effect includes possible errors with a longer code.
If the difference in code sped up the process by minutes or more, it could be worthwhile. However shaving seconds off of seconds may not be worth the risk in coding errors. 

Refactoring the VBA code is dependent on correct spelling. While VBA does provide instant feedback on errors, the potential for correcting multiple loctions for the same word can increase with longer code.
